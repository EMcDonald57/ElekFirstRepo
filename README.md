The files within this Repo are a compilation of the best work I have done during my college data analysis classes. When looking through the files, you will find PDFs of my resume, robot processing automation examples, Python coding project, and Tableau final project. The projects and assignments have been completed during my four years in college, so there is much variety in content.
